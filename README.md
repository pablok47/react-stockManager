Pablo Kaparis is using reactjs to build "Stock Manager".

Installed as dependencies:
babel-preset-react
babelify
watchify
react

This react app is a Stock Manager.  It will be an application where one could keep track of the stocks they are interested in.  They will be able to create several lists based on each sector (ex: Tech, Energy, Financials, etc.).

Is like a shopping list app only the list contains stocks of companies one likes instead of shopping items.
