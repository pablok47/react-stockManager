Pablo Kaparis is using reactjs to build "Stock Manager".

Installed as dependencies:

This react app is a Stock Manager.  It will be an application where one could keep track of the stocks they are interested in.  They will be able to create several lists based on each sector (ex: Tech, Energy, Financials, etc.).

The app is like a shopping list app only the list contains stocks of companies one likes instead of shopping items.

Features besides list feature includes:
Digital clock,
Note Pad,
Nav Bar with link to Yahoo's Financials Website set to the Logo on the top left corner of the nav bar.
